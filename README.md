DISCLAMER:
This is still a work in progress and therefore not compleated

This is the dictionary for the constructed language Primal created by Trickster.

This is to be use as a learning resource alongside those gathered by Skyhawk here: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1ZZSTmk-vP8bgne08j_ajIfp0eGVJhuoq.

This is used by having the exe file and in a subfolder named "resources" have the csv files 
there is also an optional c# based application for the dictionary though this also requires the previously mentioned setup


if you have any suggestions about added features feel free to write them
