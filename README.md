DISCLAMER:
This is still a work in progress and therefore not completed exept for the python version

This is the dictionary for the constructed language Primal created by Trickster.

This is to be use as a learning resource alongside those gathered by Skyhawk here: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1ZZSTmk-vP8bgne08j_ajIfp0eGVJhuoq.


Use:
First
Install the Primalf.ttf and run it to create the font required for the programs

Python Version

For this you need a python compiler and then just have the xls file in the same folder as the python script



C++ Version

This is used by having the Primal_dictionary.exe file and in a subfolder named "resources" have the csv files and and the Primal_dictionary_for_windows_cpp.exe for linux use there is no need for the subfolder and you just have to use the Primal_dictionary_for_windows_cpp.exe in the same folder as all other files exept Primal_dictionary.exe which wont work

if you have any suggestions about added features feel free to write them
